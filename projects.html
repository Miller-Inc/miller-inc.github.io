        <h2>Miller Inc Physics Engine</h2>
        <p>This is an open source physics engine that utilizes multiprocessing 
            compatible with a wide variety of devices. Prioritizing accuracy with 
            , this engine is made to be compatible with just about every system 
            (Windows/Linux) and able to utilize every bit of your machine's compute
            power. This project is written in C++ with a mix of CUDA and other GPU 
            languages added as more compatibility is worked into the system. To find 
            out more about this work-in-progress, see its repository at 
            <a href="https://github.com/Miller-Inc/MillerInc.PhysicsEngine.git" >

        <h2>Star Wars Card Game</h2>
        <p>This is a game that is a remake of a game that the founder of Miller Inc and his 
            brothers had played when younger. Mixed with the mechanics of another game 
            known as Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, by Capital Games and EA, this game is 
            going to offer many new experiences that were never offered in either of those
            games, including real-time combat with other players and a free-play mode. 
            While in development, the source code is made available at 
            <a href="https://github.com/Miller-Inc/Star-Wars-Card-Game">MillerInc/Star-Wars-Card-Game</a></p>
